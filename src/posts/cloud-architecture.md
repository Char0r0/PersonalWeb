# Cloud Architecture Patterns

## Introduction

Understanding cloud architecture patterns is essential for building scalable and resilient applications in the cloud.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Microservices Architecture

Breaking down applications into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

Using events and message queues to build loosely coupled systems that can scale and evolve independently.

### 3. Serverless Architecture

Leveraging serverless computing to build applications without managing infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right architecture pattern is crucial for building successful cloud applications.
